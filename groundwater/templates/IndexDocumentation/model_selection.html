<h3 id="cast-toolbox---model-selection-method">CAST Toolbox - Model Selection method</h3>
<p><strong>The Model Selection toolbox is not implemented in the CAST yet</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the work that is being completed on <em>selecting a site-specific model</em> is by using sufficiently large field dataset to rank models based on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Statistical Threshold</li>
<li>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</li>
<li>Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)</li>
</ol>
<p>The flow-chart below provides an overview of method being developed. More on this can be found in the <a href="https://prabhasyadav.github.io/CASTbook/contents/toolbox/mod_sel.html">documentation</a> of CAST</p>
